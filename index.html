            that we are engaged and we are going back home xD, i still remember that day with its details, i still remember the walk we had near city club, i still remember the
            old guy who told us "lah ytawikom li fiha lkhir" and me just saying with excitement amen amen and u having no idea what did just happen ... and you feeling shy to 
            hold my hand when we tried to enter to the coffeshop ... all those details are just beautiful but the best part of that day was when we just held hands and just calm
            silence and peace ... that feeling is priceless ... its heartwarming when you just feel so relaxed holding the hand of the person you truly love and care about 
            i will always be with you and make sure you feel happy everyday &lt;3
